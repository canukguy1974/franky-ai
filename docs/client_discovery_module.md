# Client Discovery Module Implementation

## Research on Small Business Client Discovery Methods

### Online Research Methods

#### Business Directories and Platforms
1. **Google My Business**: Access to businesses that have registered their presence on Google.
   - Implementation: Use Google Places API to search for businesses by category, location, and size.
   - Data points: Business name, address, phone number, website, category, reviews.

2. **Industry-Specific Directories**: Specialized listings for particular sectors.
   - Implementation: Web scraping with BeautifulSoup or Scrapy for targeted directories.
   - Examples: TripAdvisor (hospitality), Houzz (home services), Thumbtack (professional services).

3. **Chamber of Commerce Directories**: Local business registrations.
   - Implementation: API access where available, or structured scraping of public directories.
   - Focus: Recently registered businesses may indicate growth phase and need for services.

4. **Business Registration Databases**: Public records of new business formations.
   - Implementation: Access government APIs or scheduled scraping of public records.
   - Target: Newly formed businesses often need multiple services to establish their presence.

#### Social Media Intelligence
1. **LinkedIn Company Pages**: Professional business profiles.
   - Implementation: LinkedIn API to identify companies matching target criteria.
   - Signals: Employee count changes, recent posts about growth or challenges.

2. **Facebook Business Pages**: Small business presence and activity.
   - Implementation: Facebook Graph API to monitor business pages and groups.
   - Indicators: Recent activity, customer engagement, service offerings.

3. **Twitter Business Accounts**: Business announcements and needs.
   - Implementation: Twitter API to monitor relevant hashtags and business accounts.
   - Opportunities: Businesses expressing challenges or seeking recommendations.

4. **Instagram Business Profiles**: Visual business presence.
   - Implementation: Instagram API to identify business accounts in target industries.
   - Focus: Engagement metrics, posting frequency, follower growth rate.

#### Online Communities and Forums
1. **Reddit Subreddits**: Small business and entrepreneur communities.
   - Implementation: Reddit API to monitor relevant subreddits (r/smallbusiness, r/entrepreneur).
   - Value: Identify businesses actively seeking advice or expressing pain points.

2. **Industry Forums**: Specialized discussion boards.
   - Implementation: Targeted scraping of forum posts and member profiles.
   - Signals: Questions about services, technology challenges, growth discussions.

3. **Quora and Stack Exchange**: Question-based platforms.
   - Implementation: API monitoring for questions related to business services.
   - Opportunities: Direct questions about service needs or business challenges.

### Lead Qualification Algorithms

#### Qualification Criteria Framework
1. **Business Maturity Assessment**:
   - Startup (0-2 years): High need for services, potentially limited budget
   - Growth phase (2-5 years): Expanding needs, increasing budget
   - Established (5+ years): Stable needs, established vendor relationships

2. **Digital Presence Evaluation**:
   - Website quality and functionality
   - Social media activity and engagement
   - Online review presence and sentiment
   - Content freshness and relevance

3. **Growth Indicators**:
   - Hiring activity
   - Location expansion
   - Product/service line growth
   - Funding or investment news

4. **Service Need Indicators**:
   - Outdated online presence
   - Inconsistent branding
   - Poor customer engagement
   - Limited content marketing
   - Negative reviews without responses

#### Scoring Algorithm Design
1. **Multi-factor Weighted Scoring**:
   ```python
   def calculate_lead_score(business_data):
       score = 0
       
       # Business maturity (0-25 points)
       age = business_data.get('age_years', 0)
       if 0 <= age < 2:
           score += 20  # Startups have high service needs
       elif 2 <= age < 5:
           score += 25  # Growth phase businesses ideal targets
       else:
           score += 15  # Established businesses
       
       # Digital presence (0-25 points)
       website_score = evaluate_website(business_data.get('website_url', ''))
       social_score = evaluate_social_presence(business_data.get('social_profiles', []))
       score += (website_score + social_score) / 2
       
       # Growth indicators (0-25 points)
       growth_score = assess_growth_signals(business_data)
       score += growth_score
       
       # Service need indicators (0-25 points)
       need_score = identify_service_gaps(business_data)
       score += need_score
       
       return score  # 0-100 scale
   ```

2. **Threshold-Based Classification**:
   - Hot Lead: Score 80-100
   - Warm Lead: Score 60-79
   - Lukewarm Lead: Score 40-59
   - Cold Lead: Score 0-39

3. **Temporal Adjustment Factors**:
   - Recent website updates: -5 to -15 points (less immediate need)
   - Recent negative reviews: +5 to +15 points (more immediate need)
   - Seasonal business approaching peak season: +10 points (timely opportunity)

### Data Enrichment Strategies

#### Business Profile Enrichment
1. **Contact Information Verification**:
   - Implementation: Cross-reference contact details across multiple sources
   - Tools: Email verification services, phone number validation APIs

2. **Decision Maker Identification**:
   - Implementation: LinkedIn API to identify key personnel
   - Data points: Names, titles, contact information of decision-makers

3. **Technology Stack Analysis**:
   - Implementation: BuiltWith API or similar tools
   - Value: Identify technology usage to tailor service offerings

4. **Financial Health Estimation**:
   - Implementation: Integration with business credit APIs where available
   - Indicators: Payment history, credit utilization, public records

#### Competitive Intelligence
1. **Service Provider Analysis**:
   - Implementation: Analyze business website for mentions of current service providers
   - Value: Identify potential displacement opportunities

2. **Service Gap Analysis**:
   - Implementation: Compare business's digital presence against industry benchmarks
   - Opportunity: Highlight specific areas where services could improve outcomes

3. **Pricing Sensitivity Estimation**:
   - Implementation: Analyze business size, location, and industry to estimate budget
   - Application: Tailor service packages to likely budget constraints
